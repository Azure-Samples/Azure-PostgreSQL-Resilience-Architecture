Azure PostgreSQL Reference Architecture
Overview

This repository provides a reference architecture for deploying an Azure PostgreSQL solution with resilience, high availability, and security in mind. The architecture is designed to support disaster recovery, scalability, and performance optimization.
Architecture Components

    Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnets:
        Includes VNets with subnets dedicated to PostgreSQL databases and related components.
        Network security configurations to isolate and protect resources within the VNet.

    Azure PostgreSQL Servers:
        High-availability deployment of Azure PostgreSQL to ensure continuous service.
        Configurations for read replicas in different regions to support scalability and disaster recovery.

    Database Replication and Failover:
        Database replication setup for cross-region failover.
        Read replicas are configured to support read-heavy workloads and ensure quick recovery in case of regional outages.

    Security:
        Network security groups (NSGs) to restrict access based on IPs.
        Azure Firewall and/or Application Gateway for enhanced security and controlled access.
        Encryption for data at rest and in transit.

    Monitoring and Alerts:
        Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for real-time monitoring of database performance and health.
        Alerts configured to trigger for specific metrics and activities, allowing proactive management.

    Backup and Restore Strategy:
        Automated backup configurations to support point-in-time recovery.
        Cross-region backup storage for added redundancy.

Getting Started

    Prerequisites:
        Azure subscription with access to Azure PostgreSQL services and VNet configuration.

    Deployment:
        Follow the deployment templates and configuration scripts provided in this repository to set up the architecture.

    Configuration:
        Modify parameters in the deployment templates as needed to suit your environment.
